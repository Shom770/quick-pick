# Quick, Pick!

In light of the new rules requiring captains to make picks in under 45 seconds, this makes it a lot harder for low-resource teams who unexpectedly became captains to make educated decisions while picking. Quick, Pick! is a simple alliance tool meant to alleviate the stresses of captains who never expected to be in a picking position. Using Statbotics data, Quick, Pick! allows you to view an interactive picklist of whatever event you'd like with a breakdown of the statistics by each team.

## How does it work?
Quick, Pick! uses Statbotics data to display a breakdown by team dependent on that year's game. For example, this year (2024) the picklist page displays the Total Points Contributed (EPA), Total Notes Scored in Auto, and the Total Notes Scored in the Amp & Speaker. To read more about how these statistics are created, you can check out the [Statbotics website](https://www.statbotics.io/blog/epa) for an in-depth explanation of what EPA is.

## Demonstration
### Event Creation Page
First, you have to select an event or create an event yourself so the website knows which teams to pull the data for. You can either type in an event code (e.g. 2024cur for Curie Division  or create an event by listing out the individual teams at an event (like for offseasons where the team list may not be posted on TBA).

Here's an example of the event creation page:

### Picklist Page
The main part of the website, however, is the picklist page. The picklist page can take around 10 seconds to load for larger events (>60 teams) but otherwise the loading time is relatively short.

The picklist page allows you to sort the data by whatever metric you want (by default, it's sorted by Total EPA). There's a summary at the top of the picklist page telling you what the best pick is based on the available teams (the element with the glow behind it). For the 2024 game, it displays the best overall pick based on whatever metric you chose to sort by, the best speaker bot and the best amp bot.

During alliance selection, you can check off the teams that are unavailable for picking, updating the summary to give you the best pick on all three metrics based on the teams that are left.
