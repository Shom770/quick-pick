# Quick, Pick!
In light of the new rules requiring captains to make picks in under 45 seconds, this makes it a lot harder for low-resource teams who unexpectedly became captains to make educated decisions while picking. Quick, Pick! is a simple alliance tool meant to alleviate the stresses of captains who never expected to be in a picking position. Using Statbotics data, Quick, Pick! allows you to view an interactive picklist of whatever event you'd like with a breakdown of the statistics by each team.
